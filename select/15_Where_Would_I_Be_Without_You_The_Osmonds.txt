Once I was a kid
In land of broken dreams
My life had no meaning but then
You held out your hand
And gave this lonely man
A reason to start living again
Oh you led me to a place where now I'm shining
Clouds that I knew took on a silver lining
(Took on a silver lining)
You came into my life
Just when I needed love
(Just when I needed love)
So darling call me and I'll come a running
No matter what you're going through
Cause where would I ever be
Without you
Darling, call me and I'll come a running
I'll be there just to see you through
Cause where would I ever be
Without you
I used to exist
On the street of lonely bliss
Till I found your love, I was there
Then you came along
Turned darkness to dawn
Now you are my reason to care
(You're my reason to care)
Oh you gave me life
And helped me find a way
Out of my night
You made a brand new day
Now I can't find a way
Of ever thanking you
(Of thanking you)
So darling call me and I'll come a running
No matter what's you're going through
Cause where would I ever be
Without you
Darling, call me and I'll come a running
I'll be there just to see you through
Cause where would I ever be
Without you
So darling, call me and I'll come a running
No matter what you're going through
Cause where would I ever be
Without you
Darling, call me and I'll come a running
