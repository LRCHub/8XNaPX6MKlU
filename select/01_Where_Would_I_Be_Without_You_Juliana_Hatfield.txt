I remember when you said
How it's all in my head
You said he may be the first
But he doesn't have to be the last
Now, I gotta ask

Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

So sick of sitting in that room
Needing a new attitude
I said I don't know what to do
You said I gotta move

Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

It's alright to feel okay
Everything is easier that way
Tell me, tell me once again
It's not the end

Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

You showed me it's a crime
To never even try
I could say I'm super fine
But that would be a lie
Give it time and I'll change my mind

Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
